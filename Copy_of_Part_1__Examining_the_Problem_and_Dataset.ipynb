        "Next, we'll address missing values in our DataFrame. Missing data can disrupt the training process, as models struggle to interpret and make predictions when certain values are absent. As data scientists, it’s our responsibility to decide how best to handle these gaps.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two common approaches:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Imputation**: Replacing missing values with a calculated value, such as the mean, median, or mode of the column. This helps maintain the integrity of the dataset while ensuring no data points are lost.\n",
        "2.   **Dropping Rows or Columns**: If you have a sufficiently large dataset or the missing values are concentrated in unimportant rows or columns, you can opt to drop them entirely.\n",
        "\n",
        "To identify and handle missing values in your DataFrame, you can use the following pandas functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `df.isnull().sum()`: Identifies missing values in each column.\n",
        "*   `df.dropna()`: Drops rows or columns with missing values.\n",
        "*   `df.fillna(value)`: Fills missing values with a specified value (e.g., mean, median, or mode).\n",
        "\n",
        "💡 *Hint*: You can search each function online to access the official documentation, where you’ll find detailed usage information and examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, use column filtering to print out the rows that contain NaN. To clean and understand your dataset, it's often helpful to identify rows where specific columns contain missing values (`NaN`). In this step, you'll use **column filtering** to isolate these rows for inspection.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Steps to Follow\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Select the Column**:  \n",
        "   Decide which column you'd like to check for `NaN` values.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Apply Column Filtering**:  \n",
        "   Use column filtering with the `.isna()` method to isolate rows where the selected column contains `NaN`.  \n",
        "   \n",
        "   **Hint**: The basic structure looks like `df[df['column_name'].isna()]`, where `'column_name'` is the name of the column you want to inspect.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### General Column Filtering Tip\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond finding `NaN` values, you can also use column filtering to select rows based on other conditions. For example, `df[df['column_name'] == \"condition\"]` allows you to filter rows where a column matches a specific value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using column filtering is a powerful tool for exploring and preparing your data for analysis!"
