        "Next, we'll address missing values in our DataFrame. Missing data can disrupt the training process, as models struggle to interpret and make predictions when certain values are absent. As data scientists, it’s our responsibility to decide how best to handle these gaps.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two common approaches:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Imputation**: Replacing missing values with a calculated value, such as the mean, median, or mode of the column. This helps maintain the integrity of the dataset while ensuring no data points are lost.\n",
        "2.   **Dropping Rows or Columns**: If you have a sufficiently large dataset or the missing values are concentrated in unimportant rows or columns, you can opt to drop them entirely.\n",
        "\n",
        "To identify and handle missing values in your DataFrame, you can use the following pandas functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   `df.isnull().sum()`: Identifies missing values in each column.\n",
        "*   `df.dropna()`: Drops rows or columns with missing values.\n",
        "*   `df.fillna(value)`: Fills missing values with a specified value (e.g., mean, median, or mode).\n",
        "\n",
        "💡 *Hint*: You can search each function online to access the official documentation, where you’ll find detailed usage information and examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "-------\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, use column filtering to print out the rows that contain NaN. To clean and understand your dataset, it's often helpful to identify rows where specific columns contain missing values (`NaN`). In this step, you'll use **column filtering** to isolate these rows for inspection.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Steps to Follow\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Select the Column**:  \n",
        "   Decide which column you'd like to check for `NaN` values.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Apply Column Filtering**:  \n",
        "   Use column filtering with the `.isna()` method to isolate rows where the selected column contains `NaN`.  \n",
        "   \n",
        "   **Hint**: The basic structure looks like `df[df['column_name'].isna()]`, where `'column_name'` is the name of the column you want to inspect.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### General Column Filtering Tip\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond finding `NaN` values, you can also use column filtering to select rows based on other conditions. For example, `df[df['column_name'] == \"condition\"]` allows you to filter rows where a column matches a specific value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using column filtering is a powerful tool for exploring and preparing your data for analysis!"

        "For categorical variables with a clear and meaningful order (e.g., education levels like \"High School\", \"Bachelor's\", \"Master's\", \"PhD\"), you can manually assign numerical values to reflect their rank. This approach ensures that the order is preserved in the encoded data, which can be particularly useful for models that benefit from this structure.\n",

For example, encoding education levels or survey ratings (e.g., \"Poor\", \"Average\", \"Excellent\") as ordinal values preserves their inherent ranking and ensures that the model can interpret the relationship between them.  \n",

        "- **Logical Relationships:** Ordinal encoding works best when there is a clear and interpretable relationship between the categories. Avoid using it for unordered data.  \n",
        "- **Efficiency:** Libraries like `pandas` and `scikit-learn` make it easy to implement these encoding techniques, but always validate the results to ensure they align with your data’s context.  \n",

        "By encoding your categorical variables thoughtfully, you ensure that your data is ready for machine learning models to process effectively. Take a moment to evaluate which encoding method best suits your categorical columns, and proceed to implement it in your DataFrame!\n",
